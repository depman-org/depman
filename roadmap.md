# Roadmap

### When v1.0.0?
I have other stuff going at the moment, and creating a tool that makes software development both easier and more reliable than established ones like Bazel, Dagger, or Nix is no easy task. I believe Depman, even in its current not fully fleshed out form offers a level of convenience, simplicity (low cognitive load, less code complexity) and a rapid development speed not found in any other tool, and I value that very highly as an indie developer. I'm using Depman on my projects so I have plenty of incentive to keep working on it. If you insist on a date, hopefully before October 2025.

The following is a list of items to be completed before the v1 release. Items are removed from the list when they are completed.

## TODOs for v1.0

- Implement containerization, by dividing Depman into two parts:
	- One small easily auditable widely compatible POSIX-sh shell script that launches the main container for Depman to run in.
		- Run a rootless podman container with the project directory inside. Base image alpine.
	- The script running inside the container doing the actual job, obtaining dependencies and spawning containers for build commands.
		- Warn the user when a new depman version is released.
		- When downloading depman script check it with a hardcoded signing key.
	- Container customization, for both main container and build containers.
		- Allow to specify a different base image.
		- Execute a shell script he defines instead of RUN instructions, there's no need expose the complexity of Containerfiles.
- Subcommands
	- cache
	- retrieve
- Flags
	- --overlay
	- --help
	- --watch
-  Signing support for dependencies to be able to confirm authenticity when updating them..
-  Check whether we are using unsanitized user input as filename anywhere (this should be built into nu_livr).
-  If hash collision attack in the lockfile and elsewhere is possible, use a perfect hashing function.
-  Nearest `depman/` folder search in parent directories Ã  la `git`.
-  Implement `nu_livr` and move input validation to it as possible.
-  Create and use an errors-as-values based error handling module.
-  Implement a proper formatting standard for errors, warnings, infos, logs and other user communication. 
	- JJ has a very good UI as an example. For starters, use colors and pagers and customize nushell errors to not add a vertical line.
-  Don't parse all the files every run, cache the parsing results.
-  Nixpkgs packages and flakes accepted as a dependency type.
	- The reason why Nix and Depman packages are allowed as recursive dependencies is because only these two guarantee build inputs remain the same, by either locking inputs & using a purely functional DSL or locking both inputs and the outputs.
-  Full idempotency.
	- We are probably already fully idempotent, just have to check for edge cases.
-  Self hosting (build and test Depman with Depman.).
